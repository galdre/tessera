# tessera

_tessera_, Latin noun: A tally, token, ticket, or watchword used to assist identification and to signify promised payment or friendship.

A fundamental reimagining of some of my previous work [here](https://github.com/Workiva/tesserae). The basic idea is that tokens, delays, promises, futures, reactions, and a host of other things with no names, are all basically the same thing and wouldn't it be lovely if they participated in a shared contract/set of contracts. Extremely work in progress and experimental.
